Project layout:
MacroStats.bas
	- The library itself, IMPORT THIS INTO YOUR PROJECTS!
MacroStats.xlsm
	- The workbook used to develop the libary.
	- Don't need to add this to you to your project.
MacroStatsTest.bas
	- Mainly used to aid development, not necessary to include in your
      projects.
	- Used to aid development by ensuring that the functions work as
      promised. Ff you encounter a problem and report it to me, I'll
      add a test that should ensure the problem is never reintroduced.
